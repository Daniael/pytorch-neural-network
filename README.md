PyTorch Neural Network ðŸ§ 

A simple, configurable feedforward neural network built with **PyTorch**, ideal for learning the basics of deep learning and training on datasets like **MNIST**.

Designed for educational purposes and easy customization. Perfect for beginners looking to understand how models are defined, trained, and evaluated in PyTorch.

ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Configurable model architecture (input size, hidden layers, output classes)
- âœ… Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
- âœ… Ready for image classification (e.g., MNIST digits)
- âœ… Full training & evaluation loop included
- âœ… GPU support via CUDA
- âœ… Easy to extend or adapt to other datasets

ðŸ›  Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
pip install torch torchvision
